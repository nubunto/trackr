# Trackr

Tracker is a web tool to help you organize yourself monthly regarding finnancial situation.

## How does it work

The idea is simple. We have a collection of **sources of income** and a collection of **bills**. You add to sources of income when you _receive_ money and add to collection of bills when you have to draw money from _income_ to pay for them.

The tool can make analysis on this data, then, to tell you your current status.
